# arrayManipulation.js

This file contains the solution for the first task.

##  1:Task 1:
- Develop a function `processArray` that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array with each element squared.

# userInfo.js

This file contains the solution for the second and third challenges.

## Task 2:
- Design a function `formatArrayStrings` that receives two arrays as input:
  - An array of strings.
  - An array of numbers transformed by `processArray`.
- The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number:
  - Change the string to uppercase if the number is even.
  - Change the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3:
- Implement a function `createUserProfiles` that:
  - Accepts an array of names and the array of modified strings from Challenge 2.
  - Generates an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
